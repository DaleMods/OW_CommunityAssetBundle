What is OW_CommunityAssetBundle?
--------------------------------

OW_CommunityAssetBundle (OWCAB) is a community asset bundle which will be an asset (art, models, sound, etc) library Old World. The aim of OWCAB is to assist modders of Old World who are unfamiliar with Unity asset bundles and WWise sound banks.

To submit assets for inclusion:
-------------------------------

To submit assets for inclusion in OWCAB head over to the official Old World discord (https://discord.gg/njCAEhe). Go to the #modding channel and tag @Dale in your message. Dale will include your asset in OWCAB and update the mod. Once updated, refer to the OWCAB_Asset_List to find the asset or audio TYPE that has been assigned. Simply use this TYPE in your mod. Users of your mod will have to also download and activate OWCAB.
